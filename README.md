# acm-asm-demo
## Purpose
This repository is for referential purposes only. This code will set up a rudimentary Anthos environment with Service Mesh and Config Management enabled, which can be used to apply policied and monitor K8s clusters, but this has very minimal functionality and runs a demonstration application. Feel free to use this for your own purposes, but do not use this in production.

A more comprehensive demo can be found in the official [Google Cloud Platform Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/tutorials/strengthen-app-security). As previously stated, this Repo is for demonstration purposes only, and reflects what a production repository MAY look like if one were to use this configuration in their own cloud environment.
